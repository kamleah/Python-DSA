Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable subproblems. In other words, a function in a recursive approach solves a part of the problem and delegates the rest of the problem to itself.

In the context of computer programming, recursion is used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem. Each recursive call works on a smaller subset of the original problem until it reaches a base case, which is the simplest form of the problem that can be solved directly without further recursion.

A recursive function typically consists of two parts:

1. Base Case: The base case is the condition that stops the recursion. It defines the simplest instance of the problem that doesn't require further recursion and returns a specific result. Without a base case, the recursive function would keep calling itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.

2. Recursive Call: Inside the function, there is a call to itself with modified arguments to handle a smaller version of the problem. The recursive call allows the function to break down the original problem into smaller subproblems, which are then solved through recursive calls.

The syntax for a recursive function in Python is straightforward. Here's the general structure of a recursive function:

```
    def recursive_function(parameters):
        # Base case: Check if the recursion should stop or exit for condition satisfied
        if base_case_condition:
            return base_case_result

        # Recursive call: Call the function with modified arguments
        result = recursive_function(modified_parameters)
        # Further processing (optional)
        return result

```

Here's a simple example of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer:

```
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: If n is 0 or 1, return 1 (factorial of 0 and 1 is 1)
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive call: Multiply n with factorial of (n-1)
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

In this example, the `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 (the base case). Otherwise, it calls itself with `n - 1` as an argument to calculate the factorial of the smaller subproblem. The recursion continues until the base case is reached, and the results are multiplied together to obtain the final factorial.

Recursive solutions can be elegant and concise for certain problems, but they require careful design to avoid infinite recursion and inefficiencies. Additionally, iterative (non-recursive) approaches may be more suitable for some problems, depending on the specific requirements and constraints.
